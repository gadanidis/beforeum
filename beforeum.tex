\section{Introduction}

% TODO: introduction should reflect chapter as a whole

One of the most dramatic discourse-pragmatic changes in twentieth-century
English has progressed under the radar of laypeople and (until recently)
linguists: the rise of \emph{um} as the predominant variant of the `filled
pause' variable (UHM) at the expense of \emph{uh} \parencite{tottie2011,
fruehwald2016, wielingetal2016}.
\textcite[43]{fruehwald2016} documents this ``textbook'' change over 100+ years
of apparent time:
\emph{um} increases incrementally between generations and the rise is led by
women.
In this chapter, we investigate (UHM) at an early stage of change to determine
what triggered the rise of \emph{um}.

\section{Change in progress}

The rise of \emph{um} has now been described extensively in the variationist and
corpus-linguistic literature, across a number of corpora and speech communities.

% TODO: acton2011

In the British National Corpus, \textcite{tottie2011} observed that \emph{um}
was used more frequently than \emph{uh} by women, younger speakers, and more
educated speakers; men, older speakers and educated speakers used (UHM) more
often overall.
